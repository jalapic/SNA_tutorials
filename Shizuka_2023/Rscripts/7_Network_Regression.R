# Intro to Network Regression (MRQAP)
# predict the effect of some relational variable on network relationsâ€“e.g., how the similarity between two nodes affects the probability of an edge, or how network relations predict the transmission of pathogens
# MRQAP allows you to determine the influence of one matrix on another, controlling for the effects of one or more covariate matrices

# load packages
library(sna)

#generate 3 random adjacency matrices using the rgraph() function within sna
